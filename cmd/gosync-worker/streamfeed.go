// streamFeeder keeps the stream-change caches warm from replication.
//
// It is a replication.Listener rather than part of the notifier or the
// invalidator, because all three read the same row and want different things
// from it:
//
//   - The notifier wakes whoever the row names, and a row naming nobody wakes
//     everybody. Over-waking costs one recomputation.
//   - The invalidator drops the cached answers the row makes wrong, and decides
//     per stream what a row naming nobody means.
//   - This records "entity E changed at position P". A row naming nobody means
//     something changed and we cannot say what, which is the one case a stream
//     cache cannot shrug off: the horizon has to move rather than the entry.
//
// Folding any two of them together would force one of those defaults onto the
// other, and the wrong default here is a client silently missing an event.
