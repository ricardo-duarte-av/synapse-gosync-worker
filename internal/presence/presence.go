// Package presence tells Synapse's presence writer that a user is syncing.
//
// This worker reads. Presence is the one thing a /sync cannot answer without
// also SAYING something: Synapse's own sync handler calls user_syncing(), which
// marks the account online and refreshes the timers that keep it there. A
// worker that serves /sync and stays quiet leaves every account it serves
// looking permanently offline -- to other users and over federation -- and no
// amount of correctness in the response fixes that, because the fact is
// recorded elsewhere.
//
// It is NOT a database write. Presence has a single writer instance
// (`stream_writers.presence`, `av-edu-worker` on this deployment) and every
// other process reaches it over Synapse's HTTP replication API. So this package
// is an HTTP client and nothing else: internal/store stays 100% SELECT, and the
// only new privilege is the shared replication secret.
//
// Three properties of the writer make this safe to speak to, all verified
// against v1.159.0 and against the live deployment:
//
//   - It authorises on the bearer secret alone. There is no registration step,
//     no instance_map entry, and nothing ever calls back, so a pure client with
//     no replication listener is a supported shape.
//   - Sync-driven updates are idempotent and self-limiting. The writer's timers
//     are coarser than a sync loop, so relaying one update per interval per
//     device is enough; more is wasted work, not wrong data.
//   - A process that goes quiet expires. EXTERNAL_PROCESS_EXPIRY is five
//     minutes, after which the writer drops what we told it and times the users
//     out. If this worker dies, its users go offline on their own rather than
//     being pinned online forever.
