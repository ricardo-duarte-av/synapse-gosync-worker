// The required-state diff: given what a connection was last told to expect in a
// room and what it is asking for now, work out what has to be fetched and sent.
//
// A port of `_required_state_changes` in synapse/handlers/sliding_sync/. It is
// the trickiest pure function in the endpoint, and the reason is one idea
// repeated in several places:
//
//	A state key is only forgotten when the client removes it AND the state
//	behind it changed.
//
// If a client drops `m.room.topic` from required_state and then adds it back,
// the server must not re-send a topic the client already has. So the effective
// config keeps the key until the topic actually changes. Everything below that
// looks like over-complication is a version of that rule.
//
// It has no I/O, which is deliberate: it is the piece most likely to be subtly
// wrong, so it is tested exhaustively before it is wired to anything.

// MaxRememberedStateKeys bounds how many state keys the effective config
// remembers per type.
//
// Synapse's number. Without a bound, a room whose membership churns grows one
// stored state key per member for ever, in a table that already holds a row per
// room per connection. With it, a client may occasionally be sent a member
// event it already had -- which is the cheap side of the trade.
