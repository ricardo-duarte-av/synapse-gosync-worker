// Making a CURRENT room list answer for a PAST token.
//
// `sliding_sync_membership_snapshots` holds a user's memberships as they are
// now. A sync answers as of its token, which is usually now but need not be --
// a client polling from an old `pos`, or a request that raced a membership
// change, both land behind. Two corrections follow, and they are different
// questions:
//
//   - The REWIND undoes membership changes that happened after the token, so a
//     room the user joined ten seconds ago does not appear in a sync answering
//     as of twenty seconds ago.
//   - NEWLY JOINED / NEWLY LEFT names the rooms whose membership changed
//     INSIDE the token range, which the response has to treat differently: a
//     newly joined room is sent in full rather than as a delta, and a newly
//     left one is kept in the list so the user's own leave is the last thing
//     they see.
//
// Ported from _get_rewind_changes_to_current_membership_to_token and
// _get_newly_joined_and_left_rooms.

// membershipRewind is what one room's membership should be rewound to.
//
// A nil entry means the room must be dropped entirely: the user joined it after
// the token, or its previous membership cannot be determined.
