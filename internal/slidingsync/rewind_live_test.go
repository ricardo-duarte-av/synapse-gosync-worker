//
// The filter compares the membership against the PREVIOUS one, and the union
// has two sources with different ideas of "previous":
//
//   - current_state_delta_stream knows its own prev_event_id, so it always
//     filters correctly.
//   - sliding_sync_membership_snapshots has to reach the predecessor through
//     event_edges, which gives DAG PARENTS rather than state predecessors.
//     Measured here: it yields a membership at all only 51.7% of the time
//     (1,056 of 2,044 rows), and of those, 62.3% belong to a DIFFERENT USER.
//
// A row that filters is skipped, and nothing removes an entry another row
// already added, so a change is suppressed only when BOTH branches agree it is
// not one. That makes the error safe in the direction that matters: a genuine
// join always has a delta row with no predecessor, so it is always reported,
// while a display-name change is reported about half the time. Over-reporting
