// toDeviceEvents builds the to_device section and, when it is truncated,
// winds the response's now token back.
//
// Mirrors _generate_sync_entry_for_to_device. Two things about it are easy to
// get wrong:
//
//   - The section is served on an INITIAL sync too, from position 0. A device
//     that has never synced still has an inbox waiting for it.
//   - Only 100 messages are returned at a time, and when that limit is hit the
//     now token's to_device field is REPLACED by the position of the last
//     message returned -- not left at the current stream position. The client's
//     next_batch therefore resumes mid-backlog, and the rest arrives on the
//     following sync. Leaving the token alone would skip everything past the
//     hundredth message.
//
// Returns nil when the worker is not configured to serve the section at all.
// That is not a degraded mode: see the note on deviceinbox, serving to_device
// without being able to delete it is worse than not serving it.

// the client is syncing from was in a response the client demonstrably holds.

// they go out in this response, and the next request's `since` acknowledges
// them.

// A failure is logged rather than returned. The cost of not deleting is that a
// device sees a message twice; the cost of failing the sync is that it sees
// nothing at all, and a transient database error should not be the difference
// between a client working and not.
