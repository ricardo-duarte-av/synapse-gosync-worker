// maxTimelineRepeats is Synapse's `max_repeat`: how many times a room's
// timeline may be re-paginated to make up for events the filters removed.
//
// The cap matters. A filter matching nothing in a large room would otherwise
// walk the room's entire history looking for a tenth event that does not
// exist, once per room, on every sync.
const maxTimelineRepeats = 5

// loadFilteredRecents builds a room's timeline.
//
// Port of Synapse's _load_filtered_recents, and it serves every path: an
// initial sync (no `since`, no events supplied, walk backwards from now), an
// incremental one (a window of events already loaded, a `since` to stop at),
// and an archived room (walk back from the leave event).
//
// The arguments mirror Synapse's, because the differences between the paths
// are entirely in what is passed:
//
//   - `upto` is Synapse's `upto_token`: the token a client should paginate
//     from when the timeline is NOT trimmed. For a joined room in an
//     incremental sync it is the start of the chunk that was loaded, which is
//     the `since` token itself for a room whose events all fit; for an initial
//     sync it is the now token; for an archived room, the leave token.
//   - `sinceKey` is the lower bound of the walk, nil on an initial sync. Its
//     presence also chooses the ordering: stream for updates, topological for
//     history.
//   - `potential` is the window of events the caller already loaded, with
//     `hasPotential` distinguishing "loaded, and there were none" from "not
//     loaded at all". That distinction decides `limited` and cannot be
//     recovered from an empty slice.
//
// Two things here are easy to leave out and wrong to.
//
// The first is the loop. Events are thinned twice -- once by the client's
// filter, once by history visibility -- and either pass can leave the timeline
// short of the limit, so Synapse goes back for more, up to five times. Without
// it, a filter selecting one event type returns a nearly empty timeline for a
// busy room and calls it limited, sending the client round the same filter
// again.
//
// The second is that `limited` is decided BEFORE any filtering, from how many
// events the window held against the TIMELINE limit -- not from how many
// survived, and not against the load limit. A timeline that ends up short
// because the filter removed things is not limited; the client has everything
// there was.
