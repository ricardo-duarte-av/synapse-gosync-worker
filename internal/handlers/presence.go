// relayPresence tells the presence writer this user is syncing.
//
// Synapse calls presence_handler.user_syncing() around every /sync, and the
// state it passes is this parameter. Two details are carried over:
//
//   - `set_presence=offline` means DO NOT TOUCH presence, not "set me offline".
//     Synapse computes affect_presence = set_presence != offline and, when it
//     is false, hands the sync a null context manager that relays nothing. A
//     worker that instead relayed "offline" would actively push users offline
//     rather than merely leaving them alone.
//   - The update is marked as sync-driven, which is what makes the writer
//     refresh last_user_sync_ts and decline to override a BUSY state.
//
// A failure is logged and swallowed, exactly as the to-device deletion is. The
// cost of not relaying is that a user looks stale for a while; the cost of
// failing the sync is that their client stops working. Synapse would propagate
// the error here, and that is a deliberate deviation: our reason for existing
// is to serve the sync.
//
// Synapse also rate-limits this per user (rc_presence_per_user, 0.1/s with a
// burst of 1) and skips the relay when the limit is exceeded. We do not
// implement that limiter because our own throttle is stricter: one relay per
// device per 25 seconds against the limiter's one per ten. The limiter could
// therefore never fire on traffic that got past the throttle.
