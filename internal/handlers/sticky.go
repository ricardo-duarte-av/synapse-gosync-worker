// stickySection builds a room's `msc4354_sticky` block, or nil if there is
// nothing to say.
//
// Two rules from MSC4354, and both are the opposite of what the rest of a room
// entry does:
//
//   - An event already in the timeline is REMOVED from this section. The client
//     learns about it either way, and sticky events are spammable, so sending
//     it twice is the one thing worth avoiding. This is why the section is
//     invisible until an event ages out of the timeline -- or until a filter
//     excludes it, which is how the omission was noticed at all.
//   - History visibility is NOT applied. "Any joined user is authorised to see
//     sticky events for the duration they remain sticky". Synapse expresses
//     that by running the ordinary visibility pass with EVERY sticky event in
//     `always_include_ids`, which is not the same as skipping the pass: it is
//     also what stamps `unsigned.membership` (MSC4115) onto each event. Skip
//     the pass and the events come out visibly different from Synapse's.
