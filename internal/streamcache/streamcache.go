// Package streamcache answers "has entity X changed since stream position P?"
// from memory, so that a sync pass can skip the query that would answer it.
//
// A port of Synapse's `synapse/util/caches/stream_change_cache.py`. The
// asymmetry is the whole design and is worth stating before anything else:
//
//	A false positive is free.  A false negative is a lost event.
//
// Saying "changed" when nothing did costs one query that would have run
// anyway. Saying "unchanged" when something did means a client never learns
// about it, and nothing downstream will notice. Every decision below resolves
// in that direction, and so should every future one.
//
// The cache is a complete record of changes *above* its horizon, and knows
// nothing below it. `earliest` is that horizon: a question about a position at
// or below it is answered "changed" without looking, and an entity absent from
// a cache asked about a position above it provably did not change. That is
// what makes "unknown entity" mean "unchanged" rather than "no idea" -- a
// reading that is only sound because of the horizon, so the horizon may never
// move backwards.
