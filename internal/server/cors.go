// SetCORS writes the headers that let a browser-based client talk to this
// worker, byte for byte as Synapse's set_cors_headers does.
//
// They are not optional and nginx does not add them: on this deployment the
// CORS headers a client sees on /_matrix come from Synapse itself, so a worker
// that serves those paths and omits them is one a web client cannot use at all.
// The browser will make the request, receive the answer, and then refuse to
// hand it to the page.
//
// Synapse-Trace-Id is exposed even though we never emit it. The value matches
// upstream exactly, and exposing a header that is never sent costs nothing;
// diverging here would be a difference a client could actually observe.
//
// The one case not mirrored is Synapse's special-casing of the MSC4108
// rendezvous endpoints, which this worker does not serve.

// OPTIONS request before routing happens, so an unknown path gets 204 rather
// than 404. A browser sending a preflight for a path we do not implement must
// still be told which methods are allowed -- answering 404 leaves it unable to
// send the real request even to an endpoint that would have worked.
