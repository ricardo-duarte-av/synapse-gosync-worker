// Package lazyload remembers which member events have already been sent to a
// client, so lazy-loaded syncs do not send them again.
//
// This is server-side state with no representation in the database or in any
// token, which makes it the one part of a /sync response that a second
// implementation cannot reproduce from the same inputs: our cache and
// Synapse's are filled by different traffic and will disagree. Two things keep
// that bounded. An initial sync clears the cache before using it, so it is
// always deterministic. And the whole per-device cache expires 30 minutes
// after it was created -- not after it was last used -- so both sides
// periodically forget everything and re-send.
