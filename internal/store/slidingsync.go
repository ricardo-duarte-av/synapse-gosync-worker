// Sliding sync reads three tables classic sync never touches:

// maintained by Synapse's event persister inside the same transaction that
// persists the events -- so they are ordinary rows subject to normal
// replication, and this worker can read them without maintaining them.
//
// That is what makes a 654-room list computable at all. Without them, "which
// rooms is this user in, what type are they, are they encrypted, what are they
// called, and when did each last see activity" is a state resolution per room.
//
// Synapse keeps a fallback path (`_compute_interested_rooms_fallback`) for
// deployments whose background updates have not finished backfilling these.
// It is deliberately NOT ported: it is ~190 lines Synapse itself marks FIXME
// for removal, and on a server where it would be needed we should refuse to
// serve the endpoint rather than answer from tables we know are incomplete.
// See SlidingSyncTablesReady.
