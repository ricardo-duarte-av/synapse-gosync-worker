// Derived caches hold answers that survive a request.
//
// Sizes are bounds on ENTRIES, not bytes, and what an entry costs differs by a
// factor of thirty-five across these caches -- an access token id is a few
// dozen bytes, a 654-room user's room list is 139KB. So the entry counts below
// are not comparable with each other, and the one to think about before
// raising is rooms_for_user. A byte bound would express this better; it is not
// here yet.
//
// Two kinds live here, and the difference is the whole design:
//
//   - Immutable by construction. A filter is never edited (`user_filters` is
//     append-only), a room's version cannot change (an upgrade makes a new
//     room), and an access token's id is fixed for as long as the token
//     exists. Nothing has to invalidate these; they only have to be dropped if
//     the underlying row can be DELETED, which is what the `caches` stream and
//     the replication-drop purge are for.
//
//   - Invalidated over replication. A room summary, a room's history
//     visibility, a user's ignore list and their room list all change, and the
//     only signal we get is the replication stream.
//
// The second kind carries a hazard the first does not, and it is not the
// obvious one. It is not that an entry might be a few milliseconds stale --
// it is that our now token is built from max(database, replication), so it can
// include an event whose RDATA row has not arrived. Serve a stale cache under
// a token that already covers the change and the client's next `since` starts
// after it: the change is not late, it is *lost*, and no later sync will
// mention it because every window is bounded by a token the client already
// holds.
//
// So a cached entry is only served when replication has delivered every
// invalidation up to the token's position for the relevant stream. When it has
// not -- the window between a commit and its row -- the guard fails and we
// query. A skew becomes a cache miss instead of a missing room.

// Horizon is the now token's position on each stream that invalidates a cache,
// carried on the context because it is a property of the sync pass rather than
// of any one lookup.
//
// A context without one disables every guarded cache, which is the right
// default for the paths that have no token to check against.
