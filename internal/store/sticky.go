// StickyEvents returns the MSC4354 sticky events in the given rooms, in sticky
// stream order, and the stream position the response should report.
//
// Bounds are (from, to], as everywhere else. The returned position is the
// subtle part, and it works like the to-device one: when the limit truncates
// the result, the caller's now token must be wound back to the LAST ROW
// RETURNED so the next sync resumes there. Reporting `to` instead silently
// skips whatever the limit cut off.
//
// Two filters come from Synapse's query and neither is optional. Expired
// events are skipped -- `expires_at` is what makes a sticky event stop being
// sticky, so the answer depends on the wall clock as well as the stream. And
// soft-failed events are skipped: they are in the room's tables but were never
// accepted, and no client should be told about them.
