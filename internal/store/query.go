// query, queryRow and txQuery are the only ways this package reaches the
// database, so that every round trip is counted exactly once.
//
// The `name` is the calling method, passed explicitly rather than recovered
// from the stack: runtime.Callers on the hot path would cost a meaningful
// fraction of a 14us query, and a wrong name is a mislabelled counter rather
// than a wrong answer, which makes the explicit form cheap to keep honest.
//
// Counting happens before the call, not after. A query that fails or is
// cancelled mid-flight still cost a round trip, and the point of this counter
// is to measure how often we talk to PostgreSQL.

// round trips (BEGIN, SET LOCAL, ROLLBACK) that this counter does not see; the
// counter reports queries, not packets.
