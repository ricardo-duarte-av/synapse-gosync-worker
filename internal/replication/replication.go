// Package replication follows Synapse's replication stream over Redis.
//
// This is what lets the worker answer without being told what time it is. Every
// other source of a stream position is either a lagging checkpoint
// (`stream_positions`) or an approximation from table maxima that is wrong for
// three streams and impossible for a fourth -- typing is never persisted at
// all. See docs/tokens.md.
//
// It is SUBSCRIBE-only. A real Synapse worker also PUBLISHes a `REPLICATE`
// command on connect to ask for current positions; this one deliberately does
// not, because publishing to the shared bus would make every other worker
// broadcast POSITION rows on our account. Positions are seeded from the
// database and corrected as traffic arrives.
