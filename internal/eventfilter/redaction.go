// AttachRedaction marks an event as redacted and renders the redaction event
// that explains it.
//
// `redacted_because` is a fully serialised client event, not an id, so it goes
// through the same serialiser -- which is why this cannot live in the store.
//
// Shared by both sync endpoints for the same reason the visibility filter is:
// sliding sync originally skipped this and served the ORIGINAL CONTENT of a
// redacted event. That is not a cosmetic difference. It was invisible until a
// comparison happened to include a room with a redaction in its recent
// timeline.
