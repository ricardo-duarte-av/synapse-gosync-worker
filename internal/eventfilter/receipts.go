// ReceiptEvent renders one room's receipts as a single m.receipt event, or nil
// when there are none.
//
// Shared by both sync endpoints. The private-receipt rule and MSC4102's
// unthreaded-wins rule are the reason: a second copy of either would eventually
// disagree, and disagreeing about a PRIVATE receipt means showing one user's
// read position to somebody else.
//
// withThreads selects between Synapse's TWO receipt queries, which really do
// differ:
//
//   - `_get_linearized_receipts_for_room` (singular), used by
//     /rooms/{roomId}/initialSync, does not even SELECT thread_id and emits the
//     stored data unchanged.
//   - `_get_linearized_receipts_for_rooms` (plural), used by /initialSync,
//     selects thread_id and merges through ReceiptInRoom.merge_to_content,
//     which stamps `thread_id` into the data of threaded receipts and applies
//     MSC4102.
//
// So the same receipt is rendered differently by the two endpoints. Emitting
// thread_id from the singular endpoint, or omitting it from the plural one,
// differs from Synapse on every threaded receipt.
//
// Private read receipts of other users are removed in both:
// ReceiptEventSource.filter_out_private_receipts. Skipping that would publish
// exactly what m.read.private exists to keep private.
