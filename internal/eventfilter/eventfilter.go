// Package eventfilter applies the visibility rules to a timeline, fetching what
// the decision needs.
//
// Separate from internal/visibility, which holds the rules themselves and says
// in its own doc comment that being free of database access is what keeps it
// testable. This is the other half: the queries, the batching, and the
// translation from a stored event into the shape the rules take. Synapse keeps
// both in synapse/visibility.py; we split them so the rules can be tested
// without a database, and this can be shared by both sync endpoints.
//
// It is shared deliberately. Sliding sync originally did not filter at all,
// which was invisible in testing because every room compared happened to have
// `shared` history visibility. One implementation, used by both, is the only
// arrangement in which that cannot happen again.
